# Google-Sheets-Weekly-FF
A Google Sheets based tool to run a daily or week-long fantasy football competition. Ideal for Thanksgiving games, Christmas, or whatever strikes your fancy. 

Here's a cool tool that I'd like to community to be able to enjoy during whatever gatherings you have coming up for the Thanksgiving holiday. You can give it a whirl for this weekend's matchups. The projection data won't be available for the next week until sometime on Tuesday prior. I'd recommend drafting up some teams on Tuesday night, Wednesday night, or Thursday before the 1 o'clock kickoff (EST).


Make acopy for yourself of The Supersheets Bowl, a daily or weekend fantasy football competition.

**SETUP:**
TIP - BE PATIENT! Some scripts take a little while to run.
First, make yourself a copy of this sheet (so you can own it, don't request edit access)
Use the drop-down "Football Tools" menu to authorize, which may need to be selected twice to ensure it's ready to go
Pick a format, week, games within that week, and set owners, team names
Enter your draft order if desired (if you don't, a random one will be generated and revealed sequentially, if desired)
Select which roster positions to include and ones to duplicate (since you might need two copies of a specific player to allow a number of owners to populate a roster--like having 2x of each QB in the selected games)
Run the "Setup" from the "Football Tools" menu
Your settings will be verified and you'll be prompted to confirm your draft order, then a handful of scripts will set things up
After the setup is complete, you'll be prompted if you want to begin your draft, if you decline, be sure to go to the "Football Tools" > "Begin Draft" when you're ready
Lastly, allow access for images of the players to be shown (a yellow bar will appear at the top of the sheet)


**DRAFTING:**
Ensure you've selected "Begin Draft" from the "Football Tools" menu (not necessary if you told the setup script to begin right away)
The active picker will be shown, the available roster spots, and the next player up
Select the check box by the desired player, then wait for a pop-up that will confirm your pick for every one (be patient here too... the script can take 6-10 seconds to execute checking rosters and logging picks)
There's a toggle-able checkbox in cell B1 of "DRAFT_LOBBY" that will make either all players visible (unchecked) or only eligible players visible (checked)
Undo picks by clicking the yellow challenge flag in the upper right corner


**SCORING:**
Once you've completed the draft, you can run the "Scoring" > "Get Scores" whenever you'd like to fetch them
Otherwise set the "Scoring" > "Live Scoring ON" function and let it update automatically every 5 minutes
Live scoring should turn off automatically once games have completed that are included
The colors should seem familiar to many of you here...
Hope this brings some entertainment to some of your family/friend gatherings for the coming week/weekend!
Cheers!
Also, feedback welcome.
