 * DESCRIPTION:
 * This Google Sheet and accompanying script file will let you draft a team and play fantasy football
 * for a single game, single day, or single week of the NFL regular season.
 * 
 * This is a fun tool to make the Thanksgiving, Christmas, or just any day/week of the NFL more entertaining.
 * Find some friends and load up the spreadsheet (ideally granting them view-only access).
 * Input owners, team names, position counts, week, and day, then select which games to include.
 * Allows to duplicate players in the player pool if the ratio of QBs to owners is restrictive, for instance.
 * A draft order randomizer is included, or you could manually enter the order.
 *  
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * If you're reading this, you've made it to the Apps Script console. Simply click "Run" at the top of this page (with the "runFirst" script selected in the box that by default says "onOpen").
 * 1. You'll be prompted by a permission request of "Authorization required", select "Review permissions"
 * 2. Next select your Google account
 * 3. A box that "Google hasnâ€™t verified this app" will appear, click the "Advanced" text in the lower left
 * 4. Next select "Go to Google Sheets Weekly FF Scripts (unsafe)" <-- I promise there isn't anything malicious in here!
 * 5. Next it will say that "Google Sheets Weekly FF Scripts wants to access your Google Account", Select "Allow"
 * 6. Go back to the Sheet, which should now have two new menus present at the top
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * USAGE:
 * Football Tools Menu
 * 
 *  - Initial Setup - this function will configure the draft board and player pool based on your selection,
 * as well as randomize the draft order if you haven't entered one manually
 * 
 *  - Refresh Players - this will fetch the current active players for the teams included in the game, 
 * including projections and the previous week's scoring
 *  
 *  - Recreate Triggers - should not be needed, but if things aren't working when performing the draft, run this script
 * 
 *  - Update NFL Schedule - the schedule should be pulled upon running the initial script, but you can force it to update 
 * if the NFL has changed the schedule since it was first imported into your sheet
 * 
 * Scoring Sub-Menu
 *  
 *  - Get Scores - pulls all current scores for players (both completed and in-progress games)
 * 
 *  - Live Scoring ("ON" and "OFF"), you can enable or disable live scoring, which is a trigger that runs
 * every 5 minutes to automatically pull scoring.
